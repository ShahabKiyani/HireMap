Starting the Application:
1. Move to the 'backend' directory
2. Install node modules
3. Run the start script

To do this run the following commands in order:
    cd backend
    npm install
    npm start

Console should print: 
    The server has started!
    Database is open.

About the Database:
We are using SQLite with Sequelize.
When our application starts, the Database is viewable in the backend/db directory.
It may be useful to install the VSCode SQLite Extension to view the tables and schemas in the database.
