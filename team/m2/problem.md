Idea: Job Application Management Tool

Description: Those looking for jobs often apply to multiple positions, and each position has its own process. It’s hard to keep track of each stage of the process, the details of the interviews, and which companies offer the best benefits… location, salary (if provided), etc. It would be really helpful to have an app that could centralize all this information, helping users/applicants stay organized. This app could also include a feature that provides practice interview questions, and have a page with interview tips and things to remember when applying to jobs or interviewing. 

Core Features: 
Job Application Tracker 
A view of each stage of each application (Kanban style?). For example, “Applied”, “Interviewing”, “Offer”, “Rejected”). You can adjust each application as you move through the stages of the process. This provides a quick view of their progress, without having to navigate through company websites or emails. 
Interview Notes
For each application, users can record details about interview dates, formats (over the phone, technical exams, on-site interviews), and what questions they were asked. This way users can review past interview questions to prepare for future interviews and improve their performance.
Company Benefits
A section to track key benefits (salary, healthcare, pto, remote/hybrid/in office). Users can tag companies with benefits, and sort/filter their preferences. This will allow users to compare companies that they’ve applied to and prioritize top choices based on their personal preferences. 
Tips on Interviewing and the Job Search
A repository of interview and job search tips… maybe certain tips suggested when a user/applicant is at a specific stage… interviewing (behavioral tips) or technical exams (technical tips). This would give them practical advice at the right time.
Prioritize Applications
Users are able to mark their top choice of company to help them prioritize and focus their energies on their most desired employers.
Deadline Reminders and Notifications
Users can input application deadlines, interview dates, and follow-up reminders, to help them stay on top of important dates.
Alumni job connect
You can see who previously applied to a job and get their contact information to see if they can refer you, and since this application is designed for umass students you will be communicating with alumni so you are more likely for a referral
Possibly: Share job search progress with mentors, friends, or career advisors… for advice?
Provide statistics on the user's job process (number of applications submitted, response rates, interview conversion rates) to give insights.

Target Audience: Recent graduates, professionals, freelancers actively applying to jobs…
