# Problem Statement

## Problem Description
Job seekers, especially college students, recent graduates, and professionals, frequently apply to multiple positions, each with its own process and requirements. This makes it difficult to keep track of application stages, interview details, and company benefits such as salary, location, and perks. Without a centralized system, applicants often rely on scattered emails, spreadsheets, or company websites, leading to disorganization, missed deadlines, and lost opportunities. Managing job applications can be overwhelming, particularly for those new to the job market.

## Proposed Solution
Our web application, **HireMap**, is designed to provide a comprehensive, user-friendly solution for managing job applications. HireMap simplifies the process by helping users track their applications, interview progress, deadlines, and important job-related details. It offers tools that allow users to prioritize applications, stay organized, and make informed decisions when comparing job offers.
