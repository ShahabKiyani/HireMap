The feature that took me the most time and energy is Application Information form. The idea for this feature is that when you have an application on your account, you can double click it to direct you to the Application Information Page. When double clicked, all the information for that specific application is listed on the new page. I think this is important because it stores information that is accessible across pages.

My goal was that after the add application popup was completed, the application info was saved in IndexedDB.
Then when one of the application boxes is double clicked, the user will be directed to the Application Information page. Here the information is pulled from IndexedDB and assigned to each corresponding element.


Start on the Homepage.

Option 1:
A [Double click on an application] -----> B [Directed to Application Information Page]
B [Here you should see all of the information for that application]

Option 2:
A [Click Add Button] -----> B [Popup Occurs]
B [Fill in information and Click Submit button] -----> C [Returns to Homepage]
C [Double click on new application] -----> D [Directed to Application Information Page]
D [Here you should see all of the information for the application]
