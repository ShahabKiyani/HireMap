1. The chosen feature is the Trash Icon/Drag-and-Drop Functionality for deleting job applications. This feature allows users to drag an application box from the application tracker and drop it over a trash icon. When an application is dragged and dropped into the trash, it is removed from the DOM and deleted from the IndexedDB database, ensuring that the data is no longer stored in the browser.

2. Mermaid Sequence Diagram:

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Start: User drags application box] --> B{Is the box dropped on trash?};
    B -- Yes --> C[Trigger dragDropTrash function];
    B -- No --> D[Application stays in position];
    C --> E[Call deleteApp method in IndexedDB];
    E --> F{Is deletion successful?};
    F -- Yes --> G[Remove application from DOM];
    F -- No --> H[Display error message];
    G --> J[End];
    H --> J[End];
