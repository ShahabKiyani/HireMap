The feature I am choosing is the homepage application tracker. This is where the user will organize the applications that they have added into their system.
They will be able to drag the applications inbetween different sections, depending on where they are with their application process.

add application -> which ever section they added it to
which ever section they selected -> add application box to the section
application in the section -> drag to another section
drag into another section -> take the application box and update its section

Eventually we will have a way to organize the application by the user's preference, but that will be for the next milestone.
For now, it is organized in a queue.
