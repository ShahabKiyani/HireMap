the chosen feature that I am making my file for is the navbar feature (I am unsure if my teammates will also do the navbar). How it works is it allows for seamless routing between our pages, creating a flexible and responsive web app with multiple avenues for other features to be implemented in the various pages. On the navbar are buttons which link to their respective pages.
