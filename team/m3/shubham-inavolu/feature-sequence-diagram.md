My feature is the Interview Tips Page. The user will see tips organized in two different rows, categorized by tips posed by hiring managers or alumni. The rows will contain many tips, and the user will be able to scroll to find more tips. 

Each tip box will have a star, which will allow the user to favorite tips. Tips favorited will show up first before the rest.

In the future, I will implement a third row where all the favorited tips will show.
